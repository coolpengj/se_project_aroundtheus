# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is the third project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS and mainly focused on making a webpage responsive at different screen resolutions.

##Project Features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Grid Layout
- BEM Structure
- Optimization for all devices to for adaptivity

##Plan on improving the project

I need to more practice and understanding on when it would be ideal to use min/max functions for width. I still have a hard time underestanding when to use percetnage values, or just setting adaptive values in general. I also need more practice on grid layouts.
